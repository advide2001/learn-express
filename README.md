# Express API Learning

This repository contains the code I used to learn how to build APIs using Express.js. During my learning journey, I explored various features of Express.js, including routers, sending data, rendering HTML using Ejs, parsing query parameters and JSON data, and middlewares.

## Features Explored

### Routers
In this project, I learned how to use Express routers to modularize the API routes and keep the code organized. The routers help in handling different endpoints and their corresponding logic efficiently.

### Sending Data
I explored how to send data from the server to the client using Express.js. This includes sending responses with different HTTP status codes, JSON data, and rendering HTML templates.

### Rendering HTML using Ejs
Ejs (Embedded JavaScript) is a templating engine that allows us to generate HTML dynamically. I learned how to integrate Ejs with Express.js and render dynamic HTML pages with data from the server.

### Parsing Query Parameters and JSON Data
Express.js provides convenient ways to parse query parameters and JSON data sent by the client. I learned how to extract query parameters from the URL and parse JSON data from request bodies using Express middleware.

### Middlewares
Middleware functions play a vital role in Express.js applications. I explored how to use middlewares to add functionality to the request/response cycle. These middlewares can be used for logging, authentication, error handling, and more.
